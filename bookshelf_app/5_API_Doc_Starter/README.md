# API Documentation Practice
In this exercise, your task is to practice writing documentation for the bookstore app we created earlier.

You'll soon be writing documentation for your final project (the Trivia API), after which you'll get feedback from a reviewer. You can think of this as some rudimentary practice to prepare for that.

At each step, you can compare what you've written with our own version. Of course, **there isn't a single correct way to write a piece of documentation**, so your version may look quite different. However, there are principles and practices you should follow in order to produce quality documentation, and we'll point this out so you can check whether you've incorporated them in what you wrote.

## Getting started

* Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL.
* Authentication: None at the moment


## Error Handling

For each error you will get a status code and JSON object in the following format:

{
    "success": False,
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}

This will hold true for
400: bad request
404: resource not found
422: not processable

## Endpoint Library
